# House Price Assignment

> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. It is required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- The dataset consists of housing data for 1460 sales.
- The notebook on the assignment includes data understanding, exploratory data analysis, data splitting for tarining and test, feature scaling, feature selection using RFE, model building using advanced regression involving data transformation & regularization (ridge and lasso), cross validation, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation including validation of assumptions of linear regression-

## Conclusions
- Data has non-liniear relationship and data transformation was carried out to account for the same.
- Between Ridge and Lasso, Lasso Regressor performed slighlty better.
- Validation of assumptions of linear regression was successful
- Model performance between Training and Test data set was comparable.
- Hence it can be concluded as a good machine learning model with generalization and no overfitting.
